## Design Notes

1. **Shield Wall stays unchanged** - Skills enhance it, but the base ability remains 30% reduction, 8 seconds, 90s cooldown
2. **Party Protection is always valuable** - Provides baseline party support even when Shield Wall is on cooldown
3. **Skill Synergies:**
   - Bastion + Rallying Cry = Longer HoT duration
   - Bastion + Bulwark = Longer shield duration
   - Bastion + Inspiring Presence = Longer party buff duration
   - Counter Attack + Defensive Stance = More threat from being hit
   - Shield Bash + Defensive Stance = More threat generation overall

4. **Build Diversity:**
   - Players can focus on personal survival (Unbreakable Will, Last Stand, Counter Attack)
   - Players can focus on party support (Party Protection, Rallying Cry, Bulwark, Inspiring Presence)
   - Players can focus on threat/control (Defensive Stance, Shield Bash, Counter Attack)

5. **Not All Skills Can Be Maxed:**
   - At level 100 (48 skill points), players must choose which 2 points to skip
   - This creates meaningful choices and different build specializations
